    <p>A top Mazda executive has confirmed plans for the unveiling of a new concept described as an evolution of the stunning RX-Vision sports car concept.<br>
      <br>
    The RX-Vision was unveiled at the 2015 Tokyo Motor Show. The new concept will be unveiled at this year&#39s show which will take place in late October.<br>

      <em> &#34With the Tokyo Motor Show we will be introducing a new design concept; you can think of it as an evolution of theme of the RX-Vision&#34 ,<br>
      </center>
      <center> Mazda Vice President for R&D Europe Matsuhiro Tanaka told Auto Express.</center><br></em>
      <br>The concept is expected to showcase the design language of Mazdaâ€™s future lineup, just as the automaker&#39s Shinari concept from 2010 did for the current Kodo theme.</p>

      <p>
        While Tanaka didn&#39t say the concept previews a future RX sports car, he did infer that it might be powered by a rotary engine with the comment,<br>
        <br>
        <center>
        <em>&#34When we introduce a concept our intention from the engineering and design community is to make it a reality. What I will say is that we are making the utmost efforts to try and make this a possibility.&#34</em><br>
        </center>
        <br> In addition, it's been reported that Mazda is planning a rotary-powered sports car concept for the 2017 Tokyo Motor Show to celebrate this year's 50th anniversary of the unveiling of the Cosmo 110S sports car, Mazda&#39s first rotary-powered car.<br>
        <br> As for any production model, such a car is not expected to arrive until 2020, when Mazda celebrates its centennial. It&#39s also the year Tokyo hosts the Olympic Games. Mazda execs have previously hinted at something special to mark both occasions.<br>
        <br> Why the wait? Another Mazda executive revealed just this month the automaker can&#39t get its latest rotary engine, referred to as Skyactiv-R, to meet existing emission regulations. The good news is the executive also said Mazda has no intention of giving up.<br>
